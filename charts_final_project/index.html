            <h1>ESG in Food Industry: The Bigger, The Better?</h1>
            <h2>
                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance. For a long time investors have paid huge attention only to 
                financial factors of a company, i.e. revenue, net income, and CAGR. However, over the past few years non-financial 
                factors have caught increasing attention to better identify risk and opportunities of a target company. 
                Why are ESG factors important? Can we simply assume that those big companies (big in size and big in revenue) are 
                performing equally well in non-financial factors? 
            </p>

                    <p>
                        This project zooms into food industry to examine whether the bigger firms perform better in ESG performance. 
                        Before diving into analysis, the first question is: Why food industry? 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 2020, Wall Street Journal conducted an overall ranking of the most sustainably managed companies 
                        in the world. Top industries include professional and commercial service industry, industrial machinery 
                        and goods industry, etc.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Surprisingly, despite the big proportion of revenue generated by the food industry, 
                        there is only <strong>one food company</strong> that appears in the "top 30 sustainably managed companies" list. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Such a big contrast makes the food industry a great perspective to zoom into the topic: 
                        How are big companies performing in terms of ESG? Besides, since the food industry impacts our daily lives, 
                        it is also important to examine this industry and see how big companies' ESG performances are.

                <h2>Key focus group for further analysis - company: JBS; food category: 'Other Meats'; serving size: 112.0
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        As a global leading food company with its headquarters in the United States, <strong>JBS Foods USA</strong> 
                        is selected for this project to examine how big companies such as JBS are performing in food safety and quality.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While USDA offers massive data of a food company's food categories, product details, nutrient values, etc, 
                        the huge data also poses a question: which one to start with and what to focus on? I did some data cleaning 
                        with Python to make sure that the project puts key focus on the most essential / representative aspect. 
                        Firstly, JBS offers a broad range of food categories. Out of all these categories, 'Other Meats' (incl. beef, etc.) claims 
                        for 91% of the total counts (or 2119 out of 2340 total counts, as revealed in the ring plot below). 
                        Other categories capture the remaining 9%, including Sausages, Hotdogs & Brats, Frozen Patties and Burgers, etc. 
                        Thus, 'Other Meats' is a key food category to further zoom into. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The next thing that comes up is food serving size. Again, within the 'Other Meats' category, 
                        JBS offers a wide range of serving sizes, e.g. 112.0g, 151.0g, 170.0g, 227.0g, etc. As revealed in the tree plot below, 
                        112.0 is the most frequent serving size, with a total count of 1768, which far exceeds the count of other serving sizes. 
                        Up to this point, the key focus group for study becomes clear with strong data support: 
                        <strong>112.0 serving size of 'Other Meats' food category, offered by JBS Foods</strong>.

            <div id="subcontainer2">
                <h2 style="clear:left;">For a serving size of 112.0, JBS 'Other Meats' contains higher total lipid fat 
                    than industry average
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This section offers a side by side comparison between JBS and industry average (here 'industry' refers to 
                    all the branded companies with records on USDA website) in terms of 'total lipid (fat)' value of 'Other Meats' 
                    food category. The two plots are intentionally arranged side by side. 
                    The reason is that, especially for industry situations, different serving sizes are pretty close to each other 
                    in value, which may lead to plots being a bit messy if JBS values are stacked with industry values. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The left-hand-side boxplot showcases the total lipid (fat) value of JBS foods, while the right-hand-side 
                    showcases that of industry average. There are several key findings from the two plots: 
                    (i) For a serving size around 112.0, JBS has higher total lipid (fat) than industry average. 
                    (ii) Again for the serving size around 112.0, JBS has more extreme high values of total lipid fat than 
                    industry average. (iii) Another interesting finding is: the mean value of total lipid fat does not decrease 
                    proportionally with the decrease of serving size, which might raise further concerns about food nutrient and 
                    safety.

                <h2>
                    Despite steady growth of revenue from 2016 to 2020, JBS continuously reduced investment in ESG 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Previous analysis reveals that JBS is performing less satisfactory than the industry average in terms of 
                    'total lipid fat' of 'Other Meats' food category, despite being a giant within the industry. 
                    What might be the reasons behind this phenomenon? JBS' social responsibility report shows that 
                    despite steady growth of revenue from 2016 to 2020, the company's investment in ESG continued to drop. 
                    The opposite trends perfectly reveal a company's attention to non-financial factors such as ESG and the 
                    extent to which they care about customers' health and safety. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This concludes the main part of the project - 
                    by focusing on the food industry and JBS Foods better performance in terms of food nutrient value than 
                    industry average, which should raise our awareness and trigger thoughts on how we can force industry giants 
                    to care more about non-financial factors that are directly related to consumers' health and wellbeing.
