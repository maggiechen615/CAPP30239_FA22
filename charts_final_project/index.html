            <h1>ESG in Food Industry: The Bigger, The Better?</h1>
            <h2>
                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance. For a long time investors have paid attention only to 
                financial factors of a company, i.e. revenue, net income, and CAGR. However, over the past few years non-financial 
                factors have caught increasing attention to better identify risk and opportunities of a target company. 
                Why are ESG factors important? Can we simply assume that those big companies (big in size and big in revenue) are 
                performing equally well in non-financial factors? 
            </p>

                    <p>
                        This project zooms into food industry to examine whether the bigger firms perform better in ESG performance. 
                        Before diving into analysis, the first question is: Why food industry? 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 2020, Wall Street Journal conducted an overall ranking of the most sustainably managed companies 
                        in the world. Top industries include professional and commercial service industry, industrial machinery 
                        and goods industry, etc.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Surprisingly, despite the big proportion of revenue generated by the food industry, 
                        there is only <strong>one food company</strong> that appears in the "top 30 sustainably managed companies" list. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Such a big contrast makes the food industry a great perspective to zoom into the topic: 
                        How are big companies performing in terms of ESG? Besides, since the food industry directly impacts our daily lives, 
                        it is also important to examine this industry while exploring the ESG topic.

                <h2>'Other Meats' (serving size: 112.0) contributes the most to JBS revenue source and should be a key focus group for analysis
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        As a global leading food company with its headquarters in the United States, <strong>JBS Foods USA</strong> 
                        is selected for this project to examine how big companies such as JBS are performing in food safety and quality.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While USDA offers massive data of a food company's product categories, product details, nutrient values, etc, 
                        the huge data also raise some questions: which aspect to start with and what to focus on? To address this, some cleaning 
                        was done with Python to make sure that the project should focus on the most essential aspect. 
                        Firstly, JBS offers a broad range of food categories. Out of all these categories, 'Other Meats' (incl. beef, etc.) accounts 
                        for 91% of the total categories (or 2119 out of 2340 total counts, as revealed in the ring plot below). 
                        Other categories capture the remaining 9%, including Sausages, Hotdogs & Brats, Frozen Patties and Burgers, etc. 
                        Thus, 'Other Meats' is a key food category to further zoom into. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The next thing that comes up is food serving size. Within the 'Other Meats' category, 
                        JBS offers a wide range of serving sizes, e.g. 112.0g, 151.0g, 170.0g, 227.0g, etc. As revealed in the tree plot below, 
                        112.0 is the most important serving size, with a total count of 1768, which far exceeds the count of other serving sizes. 
                        Up to this point, the key focus group for study becomes clear with strong data support: 
                        <strong>112.0 serving size of 'Other Meats' food category, offered by JBS Foods</strong>.

                <h2 style="clear:left;">For a serving size of 112.0, JBS 'Other Meats' contains higher total lipid fat 
                    than industry average
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This section offers a side by side comparison between JBS and industry average (here 'industry' refers to 
                    all the branded companies with records on USDA website) in terms of 'total lipid (fat)' value of 'Other Meats' 
                    food category. The two plots are intentionally arranged side by side. 
                    The reason is that, especially for industry situations, different serving sizes are pretty close to each other 
                    in value, which may lead to plots being a bit messy if JBS values are stacked with industry values. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The left-hand-side boxplot showcases the total lipid (fat) value of JBS foods, while the right-hand-side 
                    showcases that of industry average. There are several key findings from the two plots: 
                    (i) For a serving size around 112.0, JBS has higher total lipid (fat) than industry average. 
                    (ii) Again for the serving size around 112.0, JBS has more extreme high values of total lipid fat than 
                    industry average. (iii) Another interesting finding is: the mean value of total lipid fat does not decrease 
                    proportionally with the decrease of serving size, which might raise further concerns about food nutrient and 
                    safety.

                <h2>
                    Despite steady revenue growth from 2016 to 2020, JBS continuously reduced investment in ESG, which reveals a lack of attention to non-financial factors 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Previous analysis reveals that JBS is performing less satisfactory than the industry average in terms of 
                    'total lipid fat' of 'Other Meats' food category, despite being a giant within the industry. 
                    What might be the reasons behind this phenomenon? JBS' social responsibility report shows that 
                    despite steady growth of revenue from 2016 to 2020, the company's investment in ESG continued to drop. 
                    The opposite trends perfectly reveal a company's lack of attention to non-financial factors such as ESG and the 
                    extent to which they care about customers' health and safety. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This concludes the main part of the project - 
                    by focusing on the food industry and JBS Foods specifically, this project reveals that industry giant does not have better 
                    performance in terms of food nutrient value than 
                    industry average, which should raise our awareness and trigger thoughts on how we can force industry giants 
                    to care more about non-financial factors that are directly related to consumers' health and well-being.

        <h3>Data Collection and Data Cleaning</h3>
        <p>
            I was able to find the data I want based on my past internship experience with MSCI ESG group. 
            However, massive data becomes a problem to deal with. While USDA does offer a lot of food-related data, 
            the data is spread messily over different tables and each single table is big in size. In order to make 
            sure the data can get loaded smoothly in front-end settings, I did some table joining, dataframe filtering, 
            and concatenation processes with the available data. Finally, I was able to generate small tables for 
            different charts and ran them successfully with JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h3>Plot Selection</h3>
        <p>
            I used 5 different types of plots throughout the project. The first plot is a circle packing bubble chart, 
            which is represented by non-hierarchical packed circles. The size of each bubble is proportional to the value. 
            That's to say, the bigger the bubble, the more sustainably managed companies this industry has. 
            I found bubbles an intriguing way to introduce the topic to my audience and show why the focus on the food 
            industry is important. I didn't choose a tree map here because there is no hierarchy among the different industries. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The second and the third charts I chose help tell the story of the product categories of JBS and the detailed 
            serving size. The goal is to show my audience why I want to focus on this detailed category: 112.0 serving size of 
            'Other Meats' category for further analysis. On the left hand side is a ring chart, which shows 'Other Meats' 
            category accounts for the dominant proportion of the total food categories offered by JBS. Ring chart comes in 
            very handy to show the proportion. On the right hand side is a tree map, which shows the detailed serving size of different 
            food categories. Here a tree map is used because there exists hierarchy within the data: food categories first, and 
            serving size within different categories. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The fourth and the fifth charts belong to the same category: boxplot. A box-and-whisker plot shows summary statistics 
            of a quantitative distribution. With boxplot, I can show the result of data analysis - how JBS is performing in terms of 
            total lipid fat compared to industry average level. A box plot also enables me to show outliers and extreme values besides 
            the average amount, which also provides more insights into the data analysis. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The final chart I used is a stacked area chart. The purpose here is to show the big contrast of growing revenue of JBS and 
            declining investment in ESG, and a stacked area chart is able to display the strong contrast here. 
        </p>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>
            One limitation of the project is that, due to the time constraints, I was only able to focus on one giant food 
            company and zoom into the most important food category. It will be really interesting to see how other food giant 
            companies are performing and if there exists a similar pattern with JBS. If I have a chance to work on this 
            project in the future, I would expand the project scope and look into other companies to get more insights out of 
            it.
