                    <h2>Industry Distribution of Top 30 Sustainably Managed Companies</h2>
                    <p>
                        For a long time investors only care or care most of companies' financial performances, i.e. revenue, net income, CAGR and neglect how companies are performing in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). Can we simply assume those big companies are performing equally well in ESG?
                        In 2020, Wall Street Journal conducted overall ranking of the most sustainably managed companies in the world. Surprisingly, despite the big proportion of revenue generated by food industry, there is only <strong>one food processing company</strong> that appears in the "top 30 sustainably managed companies" list. Thus, food industry becomes an interesting perspective to look at the question: the bigger, the better? Data Source:

            <h2>JBS Food Category</h2>
                <p>As a global leading food company with its headquarter in the States, <strong>JBS Foods USA</strong> is selected for this project to examine how big companies as JBS are performing in food safety and quality. 
                    Based on the data from USDA, 91% (with a total count of 2119) of JBS’s food categories falls into ‘Other Meats’, including beef, etc. Thus, 'Other Meats' becomes a key focus food category group for further analysis. 
                    Within this group, there are also different serving sizes. Most frequently occurred ones are 112.0 serving size, 151.0 serving size and 170.0 serving size. 
                    It is important to pay attention to serving size because it would be unfair to compare nutrient value across different serving sizes. Data Source:

            <h2 style="clear:left;">JBS Nutrient Comparison with Industry Average - Total lipid (fat)</h2>
            <p>
                Within the 'Other Meats' food category, how is JBS’ nutrient compared to industry median? 
                The left-hand-side boxplot showcases the <strong>total lipid (fat)</strong> value of JBS foods, while the right-hand-side showcases that of industry average.
                A side by side comparison shows that for a serving size around 112.0, which is JBS's dominant serving size, the company has higher total lipid (fat) on average, and also has more extreme high values than the general industry performance. Data Source:

            <h2>JBS Revenue vs. ESG Investment (2016-2020)</h2>
            <p>It is quite surprising that for Total lipid (fat), such a huge food processing company as JBS is performing less satisfactory than the industry average. Why is it the case? 
                JBS’ social responsibility report shows that despite steady growth of revenue (million) from 2016 to 2020, the company’s investment in ESG (million) continued to drop. The opposite trends perfectly reveal company’s awareness of ESG importance and the extent to which they care about customers’ health and safety. 
                Are we still confident to say food giants are more trust worthy? Probably our bodies are yearning for stricter regulations on food industry for safety and quality, especially on big giants which bring more impact to our daily life and are  assumed by a lot to be more trust worthy.
