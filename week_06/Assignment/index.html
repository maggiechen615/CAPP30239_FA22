      <h1>Fatal Police Shooting</h1>
      <p>In order to reveal the story of fatal police shooting, we made use of stacked histogram chart, calendar chart and line chart to show victims by age and gender; victims by day and victims by race. 
        Stacked histogram chart enables clear comparison between different groups. 
        Calendar provides a new perspective in terms of how many shootings happened each day. 
        Line chart enables us to dig deep into potential racial discrimination behind shooting. 
        Based on the result, we would propose that it might be helpful to further look into victims by race in proportion to the total population of that race.</p>

        <h2>Victims by Age and Gender</h2>
        <p>Stacked histogram chart provides clear comparison of victim gender and age. Victims are mostly young males (21-40 yr old). 
           Generally, stacked bar charts are used to represent how the partial elements add up to total and histograms are used to show the distributions of quantitative data (<a href="https://m2.material.io/design/communication/data-visualization.html#types">Reference: Material Design</a>). 
           Combining these properties together, we made stacked histogram chart to show the distributions of age as well as the proportion of gender in each bin.

        <h2>Victims by Days</h2>
        <p>Calendar chart shows us the spread of shooting. In 2015, May and October seem to be the two months with most shootings happened. 
            Calender charts are useful to show the daily frequencies or changes of events. Commonly, x axis represents weeks and y axis represents the day of the week (<a href="https://observablehq.com/@bensimonds/calendar-charts">Reference: Observables</a>). 
            We decided to use the calender chart because it could be complicated to have 365 days on x axis and data have a wide range of fluctuations. 
            For example, if we use a line chart instead, the line goes up and down too frequently, which makes harder to read.

        <h2>Victims by Race</h2>
        <p>Line charts are typically used for visualizing how one continuous variable, on the y-axis, changes in relation to the variable on the x-axis. 
            Though often x variable represents time, it may also represent other categories. 
            In our case here, line chart shows number of victims by race, with victim number on y axis and race on x axis. 
            The steep drop of line also attracts readers' attention to big differences of number of victims among different races. 
            Specifically, in 2015, close to 800 white people were shot and close to 400 black people were shot.</p>
