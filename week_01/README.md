Hello! I am Guo Chen and I go by Maggie. I'm a second-year MSCAPP (a master program with a focus on using cs/ds tools to deliver social impact) student at UChicago. I'm from Shanghai, China. \
I have my data selfie included in this file! One thing that may stand out is I have both a red half-moon and a blue half-moon. That's because I call myself an "extroverted" introvert - I enjoy company of friends, but also love spending time with myself, listening to music and playing the piano (started playing since kindergarten, slowed down a bit during middle school but I'm trying to pick it up now!).
